# The most dead simple dnd-kit vertical sortable list implementation

I think. I have no idea. This is a complex library with a ton of configuration and I am kind of a barbarian coder. I just wanted the most simple example.

I just copied the code out of this guide: https://docs.dndkit.com/presets/sortable

And made it a bit clearer with some tailwindcss classes.

Use the components in here to make it a tiny bit clearer: https://master--5fc05e08a4a65d0021ae0bf2.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/presets-sortable-vertical--basic-setup

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
