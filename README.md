# The most dead simple dnd-kit vertical sortable list implementation

I just copied the code out of this guide: https://docs.dndkit.com/presets/sortable

And made it a bit clearer with some tailwindcss classes.

Use the components in here to make it a tiny bit clearer: https://master--5fc05e08a4a65d0021ae0bf2.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/presets-sortable-vertical--basic-setup

How it will look:
